      <p class="item-list">The name falooda refers to a refreshing Indian dessert that consists of thin falooda noodles, which are usually produced from cornstarch, sago, wheat, or arrowroot, and ingredients such as tapioca pearls, jelly, rose syrup, milk, and soaked saba (sweet basil) seeds.
        <br/><br/>
All the ingredients are typically layered in dessert glasses, and the whole dessert is occasionally topped with ice cream, dry fruits, or chopped nuts, and is alternatively eaten with a spoon and slowly sipped. Though it is eaten throughout India, the origins of falooda derive from ancient Persia, and a similar item is still found in Iran, where it goes under the name faloodeh.</p>
